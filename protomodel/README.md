# Protomodel

This package contains the data structures for specific API generated by the `generate.py` script in the `schema` directory. The idea is to programmaticaly add methods, accessors, etc to the data structures here, where a user cannot add code directly, and extend them elsewhere where they can. This will help us hide annoying underlying methods like `Unmarshal`, which is unique to every model.

More conceptually, if we had a schema with a model called `my_special_model` on the `hello` API, it would live in the file `protomodel/hello_my_special_model.go`, it would be encapsulated in the struct called `MySpecialModel`, it would have a test called `protomodel/hello_my_special_model_test.go`, and would be extended by the `model` package like so:

```go
package model

// This file was initialized by schema/generate.py but is open to extension

import (
	"github.com/cryptometrics/cql/protomodel"
)

type MySpecialModel struct {
	protomodel.MySpecialModel
}
```

The file above is generated only once and afterward can be extended to our hearts desire.
